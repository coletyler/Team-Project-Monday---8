# Instructions of How to use the Human Monitor
This Git file contains the instructions of how to use the project code for the human monitor. After buliding and setting of the sensors, switches and collector Raspberry pi to the Adruino Uno. And setting up the Receiving raspberry pi to be connected to a display monitor to display the information collected.

1. The Arduino project code: with the code for the Arduino you must down load the the Project_Code folder onto the collector Raspberry pi and open this file, and have this code be compiled to the arduino off of the collector Raspberry pi that is connected to the Arduino this will have the code be program and installed on the arduino allowing you to collect your data.  

2. The collector Raspberry pi code:

3. The Receiving Raspberry pi code:
